## Document object model

Everything about the browser is an object,the browser is an object, the window is an object and the document is an object, Think of every element in the html document as an object and you can manipulate them,the browser generate the DOM from the hmtl document and the dom sees the document as a tree and every element as a node inside of the tree and can be directly accessed in different ways and targeted to make manipulate the dom or element therein.
The DOM can be accessed by the classname or tagname by using getElementById(""),getElementByClassName(""). The newest way to carryout this is by using query selectors like document.querySelector("") to get the first element of the list or the document.querySelectorAll("") to grab all the element.  
We can access and change element,access and change classes,access and change attributes and we can add DOM element to the DOM tree. The DOM provides a way to access these element with different methods.
