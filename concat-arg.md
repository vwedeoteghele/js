                                  ## What is Concatenation  

Concatenation is a big word but its basic javascript way of adding different datatypes into a string or other data type, basically to concatenate a string or numbers ,you use a + symbol to add them up example: "its my birthday" + " i'm throwing a party". this will console log its my birthday and i'm throwing a party. Another example: 
const age =30    "my name is Vwede and i'm "+age  .it combines all into a string or sentence.
or you can use it with a back tick and $ symbol  `my name is Vwede and i'm ${age}`. this does the same thing as before.

                                    ## Difference between parameter and Argument  

A parameter is a placeholder for the input to be supplies to the function,it comes after the function name in parathesis and the number of parameters is the number of argument you are supplying to the function. Argument are the imput you pass into the function and it gives you the output based on the what the function is written for. Given a function:
function vwede(inputOne,inputTwo) {let result = inputOne + inputTwo; return result;} console.log(vwede(23,26))
The inputOne and inputTwo are parameters while 23 and 26 are argument for the function vwede()
